Built-ins:

  Mod1-RClick           Focus the clicked window, but suppress raising
  Mod1-RClick-drag      Focus the clicked window, suppress raising, resizing the window from its nearest corner until drag completes
  Mod1-LClick           Focus and raise the clicked window
  Mod1-LClick-drag      Focus and raise the clicked window, moving the window until the drag completes
* Mod1-l                Switch to virtual desktop to the right (if exists)
* Mod1-h                Switch to virtual desktop to the left (if exists)
  Mod1-j                Lower focused window, if the focused window is in "allscreen" mode it will simply be fullscreened first without lowering
  Mod1-k [-k [-k]       Raise focused window [a second k raises and fullscreens the window [a third k raises and "allscreens" without a visible border
          [-k] [-k]]    [a fourth k raises and fullscreens across all heads [a fifth k raises and "allscreens" across all heads]]]
  Mod1-Shift-k          Shelve focused window and switch to the shelf context
  Mod1-Shift-j          Migrate the focused window from the shelf to the last focused virtual desktop, switch to that virtual desktop, and focus the migrated window
* Mod1-Shift-l          Migrate the focused window to the virtual desktop to the right (if exists), keeping the window focused
* Mod1-Shift-h          Migrate the focused window to the virtual desktop to the left (if exists), keeping the window focused
  Mod1-v                Create a new virtual desktop and switch to it
  Mod1-Shift-v          Create a new virtual desktop, move the focused window to it, and switch to it
* Mod1-Space            Switch to the most recently used virtual desktop (like Mod1-Tab but for virtual desktops)
* Mod1-Shift-Space      Switch to the most recently used virtual desktop, bringing the focused window with
  Mod1-`                Alternate between shelf (if populated) and virtual desktop contexts
  Mod1-s                Shelve the focused window without switching to the shelf, adopting the newly shelved window as the focused window within the shelf
* Mod1-Tab              Focus and raise the next window in the current context (shelf or virtual desktop), the focused window is not 'committed' as the MRU window
                        until Mod1 is released, so you may peruse intermediate windows without affecting the order until releasing Mod1.  In multihead configurations
			the next window selection is confined to the current screen.
  Mod1-Shift-Tab	Identical to Mod1-Tab except switches to the MRU window on another screen in a multihead configuration
  Mod1-d                Request the client destroy the focused window, or destroy the current virtual desktop when no windows exist on it
  Mod1-Shift-d          XKillClient the focused window (useful for misbehaving clients)
  Mod1-Enter            Alternate between full-screen and windowed dimensions for the focused window
  Mod1-[ [-[]           Reconfigure the focused window to fill the left half of the screen [ left bottom quarter of screen ]
  Mod1-] [-]]           Reconfigure the focused window to fill the right half of the screen [ right top quarter of screen ]
  Mod1-Shift-[ [-[]     Reconfigure the focused window to fill the top half of the screen [ top left quarter of screen ]
  Mod1-Shift-] [-]]     Reconfigure the focused window to fill the bottom half of the screen [ bottom right quarter of screen ]
  Mod1-Esc-Esc-Esc      Exit vwm (if vwm is the child of your X server, X exits too, so your X clients all lose their connection and die.
                        However, your clients are running under screen, and if your X server didn't exit, they won't lose their X connection.)

  *'s above indicate commands which initiate an MRU-update to be committed on the next Mod1 release.  One may traverse windows and desktops without affecting
      their MRU order by returning to the original initiating window and/or desktop before releasing Mod1.  This permits one to do quite a lot of things
      under a single, long-duration Mod1 press only committing to a potentially different focused window/desktop at the very end.
      Think of the Mod1 release as a transaction commit when coupled with the *'d commands.

Default launchers (configure by editing launchers.def and rebuild):

  Mod1-x                xterm
  Mod1-b                iceweasel
  Mod1-g                gimp
  Mod1-.                xlock
  Mod1--                xset -dpms s off
  Mod1-=                xset +dpms s on


General:

  Newly created windows are raised but not focused unless they are the first
  window on an otherwise empty virtual desktop, then they are focused as well.
  When new windows appear on a populated virtual desktop, they are inserted
  immediately after the currently focused window in the windows list, so a
  Mod1-Tab will immediately focus new windows.  Windows are kept in a MRU (Most
  Recently Used) order, keeping it efficient to alternate between an evolving
  set of active windows.

  The shelf is a sort of omnipresent and limited virtual desktop always
  available via Mod1-`, it only shows a single window at a time, Mod1-Tab
  cycles through the shelved windows.  I use it as a place to stow xterms
  running backround processes I would like to retain the ability to observe the
  output of or interact with occasionally.  Programs like transmission-gtk,
  cmus, wpa_supplicant under xterm, sometimes even iceweasel sessions find
  themselves in my shelf on a regular basis.


Multihead/Xinerama:

  In multihead configurations new windows are placed on the screen containing
  the pointer if that screen is empty.  Should the pointer be on a non-empty
  screen, then new windows are placed on the screen containing the currently
  focused window.

  New windows will automatically be focused if the screen they were placed on
  is empty, even if their virtual desktop is not, which is a divergence from
  the single-headed behavior where only lone windows on virtual desktops are
  automatically focused.
